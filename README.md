# Online Resume Project

A resume is an essential tool for the job hunter. For web developers it makes sense
to create an online resume – it is a great way to show off your skills and design
sense and it makes you visible 24/7.

Your final product for this project will be an online resume for yourself. Link the resume to your GitHub
web site.

## Computer Days

You will probably want to use Chrome for this, it's developer mode is a little
saner than Safari's.

1. Create a repository on GitHub for your resume.
1. Clone it to your computer.
1. Grab a copy of the HTML and CSS source from [A Case for Responsive Résumés]
(http://alistapart.com/article/a-case-for-responsive-resumes), it is a non-trivial,
but relatvely easy to follow example of a simple resume.
1. Commit them to the respository.
1. Load the sample resume into your browser and confirm that you can preview it.
1. Study the source of the HTML and start converting it to include your information.
1. Once you've updated it to reflect you, commit your changes to your repository.
1. Test in the browser to see if you have any glitches (and fix and commit them).

## Non-computer Days

1. Colect a list of your jobs, community involvement, school (especially skills you've
learned – say a bit of web design), and awards you've earned.
1. Start with the HTML handout.
1. Work in small groups to "jigsaw" the code – look for patterns and start
making sense of it.
