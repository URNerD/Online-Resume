## Computer Days

You will probably want to use Chrome for this, it's developer mode is a little
saner than Safari's.

1. Create a repository on GitHub for your resume.
1. Clone it to your computer.
1. Grab a copy of the HTML and CSS source from that article above.
1. Commit them to the respository.
1. Load the sample resume into your browser and confirm that you can preview it.
1. Start doing some simple experiments to get familiar with the HTML and CSS.

## Non-computer Days

1. Start with the HTML handout.
1. Work in small groups to "jigsaw" the code – look for patterns and start
making sense of it.
